# quake-pulse
Quake-Pulse is a data visualization project based on real-time earthquake data provided by the [USGS (United States Geological Survey)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).  
It collects global earthquake data from the past 30 days and creates an animated, artistic world map using Plotly to visualize the distribution and magnitude of seismic events over time.
